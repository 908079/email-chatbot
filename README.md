## Project Description

Smart Mailbox Assistant is a nifty Streamlit-based web application that supercharges your email management experience with the power of AI ðŸ§ ! By using OpenAI's language models and integrating with Gmail via Zapier, our assistant provides an intuitive, conversation-like interface for you to interact with your emails.

## Features

* OAuth Authentication: Enjoy a secure environment as the application uses OAuth for authenticating with Zapier, allowing the AI to safely access and interact with your Gmail data.

* Natural Language Commands: Command your email like a boss! The assistant interprets natural language commands for actions such as retrieving emails.

* AI-Powered Responses: Leveraging OpenAI's language models, the assistant provides detailed and relevant responses based on your email data.

* Feedback System: Your feedback matters! Users can provide feedback on the AI's responses, helping to improve the system over time.
